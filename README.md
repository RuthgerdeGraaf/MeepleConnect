## About The Project

**MeepleConnect**   is a cutting-edge web API crafted to assist board game stores in managing their daily tasks efficiently. 
This API enhances workflows for both customers and store staff. It allows customers to explore collections, place orders, 
and handle their invoices effortlessly, while enabling staff to manage inventory and process orders smoothly.


### Features

additional information like session feedback can be added later.
- **Customer Profile Management**: Customers can create and manage their profiles and view their reservations.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure access ensures that users can only perform actions within their permissions.
- **Game Inventory Management**: Staff can add new customers and board games to the system.
- **Session Scheduling**: Staff can schedule play sessions, including setting the time and date. Staff can add game instructions in PDF format for the sessions.
- **Order and Purchase Interest Management**: If a customer decides to purchase a game, this interest can be added to their profile.
Staff can cancel reservations if the customer is no longer interested.
- **Session and Order Tracking**:Track information about play sessions, including player details, game details, session time, and number of participants.
